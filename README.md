# Digit Recognition with Deep Learning

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Description
This project implements a deep learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits (0â€“9) from images.  
The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, a benchmark dataset widely used in computer vision.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **MNIST**: 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels).
- Split: 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:
- Conv2D â†’ ReLU â†’ MaxPooling
- Conv2D â†’ ReLU â†’ MaxPooling
- Flatten â†’ Dense(128, ReLU) â†’ Dense(10, Softmax)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/digit-recognition-deeplearning.git
   cd digit-recognition-deeplearning
